unnamed
=======

unnamed is a Minecraft Forge mod, building on-top the pre-existing functionality of Minecraft
by bringing new content that is in-line with the base-game. Licensed under the MIT License.

unnamed is developed under two principles:

- Expanding the game in a way that fits in with the content of the base game
- Expanding pre-existing content to not leave the base game behind
